      <h2 id=for>What is DBOS?</h2>

      <p>DBOS is a tool for dedicating new scientific findings to the public domain.</p>

      <h2 id=work>How does DBOS work?</h2>

      <p>DBOS gives contributors a <a href=/publish>short online form</a> to fill out with information on new findings they want to contribute to the public domain.  DBOS publishes submissions instantly and verifiably,  both to read online, and to download as well-structured computer data for indexing, searching, and backup.</p>

      <p>Every DBOS publication contains:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a description of a new scientific finding</li>
        <li>metadata to categorize and contextualize the finding</li>
        <li>a <a href=/declaration>public declaration</a> of commitment to contribute the finding to the public domain</li>
        <li>a <a href=/license>public license</a> for the content of the submission</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These elements work together to do as much as possible, as quickly, cheaply, and easily as possible, to put the finding in the public domain.</p>

      <h2 id=copyright>How does DBOS address copyright?</h2>

      <p>The <a href=/license>public license</a> that contributors grant for their submissions gives everyone very broad permission to work with DBOS submissions.  The license is similar in scope to a dedication of copyright and similar rights to the public domain, with two conditions to prevent misrepresentation of what was submitted and abuse of the contributor&rsquo;s name.</p>

      <p>The license works much like <a href=https://creativecommons.org>Creative Commons</a> licenses applied to other creative work, like article preprints, but far shorter, quicker to use, and specialized to DBOS-style submissions.</p>

      <h2 id=patent>How does DBOS address patent?</h2>

      <p>Some new findings may contain patent-eligible &ldquo;inventions&rdquo; under one or many countries&rsquo; laws.  When patents are a concern, DBOS helps scientists win the patent race for the public domain by publishing, immediately and verifiably, with rich metadata that makes it easy to identify as &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; to stop later patent applications.  By combining publication with a <a href=/declaration>commitment to keep the finding open</a> and a <a href=/license>permissive copyright license for the submission</a>, DBOS combines the expediency of defensive publication with the availability of open-access scholarship and the empowerment of open-source licensing.</p>

      <h2 id=race>What's the &ldquo;race to the publisher&rdquo;?</h2>

      <p>Under many countries&rsquo; patent rules, publishing a description that teaches others how to use a legal &ldquo;invention&rdquo; stops anyone, even the one publishing, from receiving a patent later.  Since the <a href=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ29/content-detail.html>America Invents Act</a>, much the same is now true under United States patent rules, with an exception: the one who published can still receive a patent by applying within one year.</p>

      <p>Under either kind of rule, securing findings for the public domain is a race to publish.  If a patent-seeker applies for a patent or publishes first, a patent can keep the finding closed for twenty years or more.  If anyone contributes to the public domain first&mdash;creating &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; that others can find later&mdash;the work stays open, even if someone else made the same finding earlier.</p>

      <p>DBOS publications meet all the publication requirements for patent-stopping prior art under United States and European patent rules, as well as the rules of many other countries.  The <a href=/license>public license</a> enables others to republish to meet other countries&rsquo; prior art requirements, such as publication in the country, or translation into the local language.</p>

      <h3 id=defensive-publication>Defensive Publication Bulletin</h3>

        <p>At a high level, DBOS is probably closest to a &ldquo;defensive publication&rdquo; journal or bulletin, such as <a href=http://www.researchdisclosure.com/>Research Disclosure</a>.  Like a defensive publication bulletin, DBOS accepts and publishes terse descriptions of new inventions and discoveries.  These descriptions qualify as prior art, preventing later patent applications.  Unlike a defensive publication bulletin, DBOS is free to use, free to access, and preserves richer metadata, making it easier to search and find records.</p>

      <h3 id=traditional-journal>Traditional Journal</h3>

      <p>DBOS lets scientists describe their inventions in their own words, without translating into the legal language of patents or shoehorning into the house format of a print publication.  Scientific peers do not review DBOS publications.  Unlike traditional journal articles, DBOS publications are born digital and available to everyone, free of charge to anyone, with generous permission to copy, republish, aggregate, and adapt.</p>

      <h3 id=open-access-journal>Open-Access Journal</h3>

      <p>See the <a href=#traditional-journal>comparison to traditional journals</a>.</p>

      <p>Unlike an open-access journal, DBOs publications are purpose-built to stop patents, optionally including metadata about relevant patent classifications.  DBOS publication is also much faster than open-access publication, without peer review, formatting, or other manual work between submission and publication.  Finally, DBOS publication data is much denser and easier to work with than most open-access publications.</p>

      <h3 id=preprint-server>Preprint Server</h3>

      <p>See the <a href=#traditional-journal>comparison to traditional journals</a> and <a href=#open-access-journal>comparison to open-access journals</a>.</p>

      <p>Preprint servers like <a href=http://biorxiv.org target=_blank>bioR&#x1D712;iv</a> combine nearly-instant publication with rich metadata and searchability.  Some servers offer an easy way to apply a permissive copyright license, such as a <a href=https://creativecommons.org>Creative Commons</a> license.  However, preprints are still prepared in the format and style of academic publications, and shared in bulky, difficult-to-process PDF format.</p>

      <h3 id=patent-application>Patent Application</h3>

      <p>Patent applications ask the government to grant patents, but those who receive patents can choose to dedicate them to the public domain.  DBOS publications stop patents from being enforced on inventions by preventing patents from being granted in the first place, like the old defensive publication and statutory invention registration procedures.  Preparing a DBOS publication is much faster, easier, and cheaper than preparing a patent application, without the need to translate into the peculiar, legal language of patents, format for submission, or interface with a regimented bureaucratic process.  DBOS publications appear immediately, worldwide.  Inventors can still claim credit for their inventions, but may also submit anonymously.</p>

      <h3 id=open-license>Open License</h3>

      <p>Like an open license, DBOS publications give the public broad permissions and open materials and ideas by bringing legal terms and scientific materials together in digital form, on the Internet.  Unlike an open license, however, DBOS publications are born as well structured data, rich in useful metadata.  In this way, DBOS offers many of the benefits of combining open creative work with an open license, an Internet-based repository, and a metadata standard like <a href=https://spdx.org>Software Package Data eXchange</a>, a <a href=https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>software package file standard</a>, or <a href=https://www.w3.org/Submission/ccREL/>ccREL</a>.</p>

      <h3 id=weblog>Weblog</h3>

      <p>Like a weblog, DBOS allows scientists to publish to the Internet instantaneously, in a format with few inconvenient constraints, and opportunity to categorize and link their disclosures for context.  Bloggers may also choose to apply open licenses to their posts.  DBOS publications offer the advantages of good, structured, machine-readable data on top of the searchability that general Internet search engines provide.  The standard format of DBOS publications, as well as their public licenses and cryptographic features, allow others to syndicate, index, aggregate, and archive them, efficiently and reliably.</p>
